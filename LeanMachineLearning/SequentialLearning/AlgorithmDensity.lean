# Algorithm density

We define a density function that allows obtaining the law of the history under one algorithm from
the law of the history under another algorithm when they are interacting with the same
environment. This also requires one algorithm to be absolutely continuous with respect to another, a
concept that we also introduce here.

## Main definitions

* `AbsolutelyContinuous alg alg₀`: `alg` is absolutely continuous with respect to `alg₀` (also
  denoted `alg ≪ₐ alg₀`) when, in every situation, a set of actions with probability zero under
  `alg₀` also has probability zero under `alg`. Intuitively, `alg` never acts in a way that `alg₀`
  would never act.
* `density alg alg₀ n`: a density function that allows obtaining the law of the history at time `n`
  under `alg` from the law of the history at time `n` under `alg₀` when they are interacting with
  the same environment and `alg ≪ₐ alg₀`.

## Main results

* `absolutelyContinuous_map_hist`: the law of the history at time `n` under `alg` is absolutely
  continuous with respect to the law of the history at time `n` under `alg₀` when they
  are interacting with the same environment and `alg ≪ₐ alg₀`.
* `hasLaw_hist_withDensity`: the law of the history at time `n` under `alg` is the law of the
  history at time `n` under `alg₀` with density `alg.density alg₀ n` when they are interacting
  with the same environment and `alg ≪ₐ alg₀`.
