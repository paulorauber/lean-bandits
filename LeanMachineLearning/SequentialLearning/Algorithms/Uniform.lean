/-! # The Uniform algorithm

An algorithm that chooses actions uniformly at random in every situation.

## Main definitions

* `uniformAlgorithm`: a uniform algorithm with actions in a finite non-empty type `𝓐`.

## Main results

* `absolutelyContinuous_uniformAlgorithm`: every algorithm with actions in `𝓐` is absolutely
  continuous with respect to the uniform algorithm with the same type of feedback.
